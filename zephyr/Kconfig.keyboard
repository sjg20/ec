	select HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN
	default n if ARCH_POSIX
	default y
	help
	  Enable compilation of support for scanning a keyboard and providing
	  the resulting input to the AP over the host interface. This consists
	  of a keyboard-scanning task which provides key scans via it calling
	  keyboard_state_changed() (for i8042) or its client calling
	  keyboard_scan_get_state() (for MKBP).

	  Enabling this automatically enables HAS_TASK_KEYSCAN since keyboard
	  scanning must run in its own task.

if PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD

choice "Protocol select"
	prompt "Select the keyboard protocol to use"
	help
	  Select the keyboard protocol used to communicate key presses to the
	  AP. PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042 is supported by x86 compatible
	  application processors, and PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_MKBP is
	  used for ARM application processors.

config PLATFORM_EC_KEYBOARD_PROTOCOL_8042
	bool "i8042"
	select HAS_TASK_KEYPROTO
	help
	  Use the i8042 protocol to communicate with the AP. This dates from the
	  Intel 8042 keyboard controller chip released in 1976. It uses two-way
	  communication via a few 8-bit registers, allowing key codes to be
	  sent to the AP when keys are pressed and released.

	bool "A mechanism for passing KSO2 to H1 which inverts the signal"
	help
	  This option enables a mechanism for passing the column 2
	  to H1 which inverts the signal. The signal passing through H1
	  adds more delay. Need a larger delay value. Otherwise, pressing
	  Refresh key will also trigger T key, which is in the next scanning
	  column line. See http://b/156007029.

	  This command prints the state of the i8042 keyboard protocol and

	    internal    - Show internal information
