	bool "PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) LEDs"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_PWM
	help
	  Enable PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controlled LEDs that conform to
	  the Chromium OS LED behavior specification.

	  Your board files must implement the led_get_brightness_range() and
	  led_set_brightness() which are used by the LED PWM module to set the
	  board LEDs in response to power and charging events.

if PLATFORM_EC_LED_PWM
config PLATFORM_EC_LED_PWM_COUNT
	int "Number of PWM LEDs"
	default 1
	help
	  This sets the number of PWM LEDs that are controlled by the common
	  PWM LED policy. The maximum number of PWM LEDs is currently 2.

	  TODO(b/177452529): Set this parameter from the device tree.

config PLATFORM_EC_CMD_LEDTEST
	bool "Console command: ledtest"
	default y
	help
	  Enable the "ledtest" command. This command lets you override the
	  automatic control of the platform LEDs. For example:

	    ledtest 0 enable red

	  disables automatic control of the first PWM LED and forces the LED
	  color to red.  Set the 2nd parameter to "disable" to return back
	  to automatic control:

	    ledtest 0 disable
