# Note: below output type is not correct, but good enough for
# developing right now.  We need to run ecst to pack the RO/RW binary
# into the special NPCX format, but don't do that now.
#
# So, when flashing, please flash
# build-singleimage/zephyr/zephyr_volteer.bin instead until Zmake
# grows a configuration option to handle ecst.

# Note: the Zephyr SDK is not available by default in the chroot.
# Please follow
# https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/installation_linux.html
# for instructions on installing the SDK.

# If you are building outside of the chroot on a gLinux machine, the
# arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain seems to work fine.  If you prefer this
# toolchain, you can pass --toolchain=arm-none-eabi to zmake
# configure, and that will work as well.
