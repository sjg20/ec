config PLATFORM_EC_RTC
	bool "Real-time clock (RTC)"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for a real-time clock. Typically this is available
	  on-chip in the EC. It provides a way to track the passage of time
	  in terms of second and minutes. Once set, and provided that it has a
	  suitable power source, it should be able to keep reasonably accurate
	  time over a period of days and weeks.

	  The starting EC clock is typically set by the AP, since it has access
	  to the outside world and can often obtain the current time when
	  desired.

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC
	bool "Console command: rtc"
	default y
	help
	  This command allows getting and setting the current RTC value. The
	  value is in seconds since the Epoch (midnight on 1/1/70). You can
	  convert this to a human date on the command line with 'date -u -d @n'
	  where n is the numeric value. To convert a time to seconds, use:

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC_ALARM
	bool "Console command: rtc_alarm"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_RTC
	default y
	help
	  This command supports setting a real-time-clock (RTC) alarm that
	  causes an interrupt when the timer reaches that point. To set the
	  alarm:

	     rtc <sec> [<usec>]

	  where:
	    <sec> is the number of seconds since the epoch
	    <usec> is the optional number of microseconds (fractional seconds)

config PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD_RTC
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_RTC_GET_VALUE etc."
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	default y
	help
	  Enables support for EC_CMD_RTC_GET_VALUE, EC_CMD_RTC_SET_VALUE,
	  EC_CMD_RTC_GET_ALARM and EC_CMD_RTC_SET_ALARM which colectively allow
	  the AP to control the EC's real-time-clock. The AP typically makes
	  use of the EC's RTC to avoid needing a discrete RTC chip on the board.

choice "SHA256 method"

	help
	  The verified boot mechanism requests the hash of the entire read-write

config PLATFORM_EC_SHA256_SW
	bool "Compute SHA256 in software"

	  Enable this if your EC chip does not support hardware-accelerated

config PLATFORM_EC_SHA256_HW_ACCELERATE
	bool "Compute SHA256 in hardware"
	help
	  Enable this if your EC chip supports hardware-accelerated SHA256

	  The platform switches include:
	    LID open
	    power button pressed
	    write protect disabled
	    recovery switch

          This also enables the "mmapinfo" console command to report the current

	  Enable throttling the CPU based on the temperature sensors. When they

	default y
	help
	  Indicates that the SoC supports throttling. This means that a

	help
	  This command shows the current status of AP throttling. Both soft
	  (type 0) and hard (type 1) throttling are supported. Soft throttling
	  is typically controlled by the AP via a host event. Hard throttling
	  typically uses the PROCHOT (Processor Hot) signal on x86 CPUs.

	  Example output:

	     AP throttling type 0 is off (0x00000000)
	     AP throttling type 1 is off (0x00000000)

menuconfig PLATFORM_EC_TIMER

	help
	  Enable compilation of the EC timer module. This provides support for

config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_GETTIME

	default y
	help
	  Enable the "gettime" command. This shows the current time (in

	     Time: 0x0000000002706a62 = 40.921698 s


config PLATFORM_EC_CONSOLE_CMD_TIMERINFO
	bool "Console command: timerinfo"

	  Enable the "timerinfo" command which shows the current time (in
	  microseconds and seconds since boot), the deadline (next time the EC
	  needs to wake up) and a list of active timers along with when they
	  will next fire.

	  Example:

	  Enable the "waitms" command. This waits for a given number of
	  milliseconds. For example:

	    waitms 100

	  waits for 100ms. Note that long waits can introduce problems since
	  it stops the EC from executing its normal tasks. For example, a
	  two-second wait can cause the EC to reset.

config PLATFORM_EC_VBOOT_HASH
	bool "Host command: EC_CMD_VBOOT_HASH"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_HOSTCMD
	default y
	help
	  Allows the AP to request hashing functions from the EC.

	  Verified boot can update the EC's read/write code when it detects
	  that it is an incorrect version. It detects this by asking the EC to
	  hash itself. If the hash is incorrect, new code is write to the EC's
	  read/write area.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	bool "Secure temporary storage for verified boot"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for storing a block of data received from the AP so it
	  can be read back later by the AP. This is helpful since the AP may
	  reboot or resume and want the data early in its start-up before it
	  has access to SDRAM.

	  There are a fixed number of slots and each can hold a fixed amount of
	  data (EC_VSTORE_SLOT_SIZE bytes). Once a slot is written it is locked
	  and cannot be written again unless explicitly unlocked.

	  Stored data is preserved when the EC moved from RO to RW.

config PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE_SLOT_COUNT
	int "Number of slots"
	depends on PLATFORM_EC_VSTORE
	default 1
	help
	  Set the number of slots available in the verified-boot store. The
	  number required depends on the AP firmware. Typically the vstore is
	  used only for recording a hash of the read-write AP firmware for
	  checking on resume. For this, one slot is enough.

config PLATFORM_EC_SYSTEM_UNLOCKED
	bool "System unlocked: allow dangerous commands while in development"

	help
	  System should remain unlocked even if write protect is enabled.

	  NOTE: This should ONLY be defined during bringup, and should never be
	  defined on a shipping / released platform.

	  When defined, CBI allows ectool to reprogram all the fields.
	  Normally, it refuses to change certain fields. (e.g. board version,
	  OEM ID)

	  Also, this enables PD in RO for TCPMv2.

config PLATFORM_EC_BYPASS_CBI_EEPROM_WP_CHECK

	help
	  Bypass the CBI EEPROM write protect checks. This should ONLY be
